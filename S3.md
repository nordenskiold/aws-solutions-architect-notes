##S3

###Overview
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. 

####S3 Storage Tiers
**S3 - All Tiers**
- 99.99% Availability (4 nines) / 99.95% Availability for One Zone
- 99.999999999% Durability  (11 nines)

**S3 - Standard**
Stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities and designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently.

**S3 - Infrequently Accessed (S3 IA)**
For data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed. Lower base cost than S3, but you are charged a retrieval fee.

**S3 - One Zone Infrequently Accessed (IA)**
For where you want a lower-cost option for infrequently accessed data, but do not require the multiple Availability Zone data resilience. 

**S3 - Intelligent Tiering**
Designed o optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead.

**S3 - Glacier**
Secure, durable, and low-cost storage class for data archiving. Retrieval times configurable from minutes to hours.

**S3 - Glacier Deep Archive**
AWS S3 lowest-cost storage class where aretrieval time of 12 hours is acceptable.

####S3 Buckets
S3 consists of buckets which can be thought of as directories containing a collection of objects. By default all newly created buckets are private. This can be changed with:
- **Bucket Policies** - Change permissions for all objects in a bucket
- **Access Control Lists** - Change permissions for certain objects in a bucket

####S3 Objects
- **Key** - This is simply the name of the object
- **Value** - This is simply the data and is made up of a sequence of bytes
- **Version ID** - ID used for versioning
- **Metadata** - Data about the data you are storing
- **Subresources**
     - **Access Control Lists** - can be used to set object permissions
     - **Torrent** - can be used to return the torrent file asosciated with the object
    
####S3 Consistency Model
- Read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects
- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate) 

####S3 Access Logs
S3 buckets can be configured to create access logs which log all requests made to the S3 bucket. This can be sent to another bucket and even another bucket in another account.

####S3 Encryption
- **Encryption In Transit** is achieved by SSL/TLS
- **Encryption at Rest (Server Side)** is achieved by
    - S3 Managed Keys - **SSE-S3**
    - AWS Key Management Service, Managed Keys - **SSE-KMS**
    - Server Side Encryption With Customer Provided Keys - **SSE-C**
    - Client Side Encryption

####S3 Versioning
- Stores all versions of an object (including all writes and even if you delete an object)
- Once enabled, Versioning cannot be disabled, only suspended
- Integrates with Lifecycle rules
- Versioning's MFA Delete capability, which uses multi-factor authentication, can be used to provide an additional layer of security
- Versioning stores all versions of an object (including all writes and even if you delete an object)

####S3 Lifecycle Rules
- Automates moving your objects between the different storage tiers
- Can be used in conjunction with versioning
- Can be applied to current versions and previous versions

####S3 Cross Region Replication
- Requires versioning to be enabled on both source and destination bucket
- Regions must be unique between the source and destination bucket
- Can replicate entire bucket or objects in bucket based on prefix/tags
- Once CRR is enabled, only new files uploaded to source bucket will be replicated. Enabling CRR will not replicate existing files in a bucket
- Delete markers in source buckets are not replicated to the destination bucket
- Deleting individual versions or delete markers will not be replicated

####S3 Transfer Acceleration
S3 Transfer Acceleration utilises the CloudFront Edge Network to accelerate uploads to S3. Instead of uploading directly to your S3 bucket, you can use a distinct URL to upload directly to an edge location which will then transfer that file to S3. You will get a distinct URL to upload to: https://<YOUR-BUCKET-NAME\>.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com

###Key Take Aways
- S3 is **Object-based**: i.e. allows you to upload files
- Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB
- There is unlimited storage
- Files are stored in Buckets
- **S3 is a universal namespace**. Names **must** be globally unique
- S3 URL always looks like: "https://s3-<REGION\>.amazonaws.com/<BUCKET_NAME\>". Ex: "https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/my-cool-bucket"
- Not suitable to install an operating system or database on
- Successful uploads will generate a **HTTP 200 ** status code
- By default all newly created buckets are **PRIVATE**. You can setup access control to your buckets using **Bucket Policies** and **Access Control Lists**
- S3 buckets can be configured to create access logs which log all requests made to the S3 bucket. This can be sent to another bucket in your AWS account **or** to another bucket in another AWS account
- Access to buckets can be controlled using either an ACL or a bucket policy

## Elastic File System (EFS)

### Overview
Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) is a file storage service for Amazon Elastic Computer Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. Amazon EFS is easy to use and provides a simple interface that allows you to create and configure file systems quickly and easily. With Amazon EFS, storage capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files, so your applications have the storage they need, when they need it.

### Key Take Aways
- Supports the Network File System version 4 (NFSv4) protocol
- You only pay for the storage you use (no pre-provisioning required)
- Can scale up to petabytes
- Can support thousands of concurrent NFS connections
- Data is stored across multiple azs within a region
- Read after write consistency

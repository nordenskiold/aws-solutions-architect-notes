## CloudTrail

### Overview
AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. With CloudTrail, you can log, continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure. CloudTrail provides event history of your AWS account activity, including actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools, and other AWS services. 

### Key Take Aways
- Allows you to identify which users and accounts called AWS, along with the source IP address from which the calls were made, and when the calls occurred.
- Do not confuse with **CloudWatch**; CloudTrail is all about auditing. CloudWatch is all about performance.

It is designed to be a highly scalable, easy to use and a cost effective way for developers and businesses to convert (or “transcode”) media files from their source format into versions that will playback on devices like smartphones, tablets and PCs. It provides transcoding presets for popular output formats, which means that you don't need to guess which settings work best on particular devices.
